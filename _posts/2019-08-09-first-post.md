Every semester the amfoss club of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri takes in new members. However, not everyone gets to become a member of the prestigious club. Only those who are willing to learn new stuff and work accorrdingly are made members of the club.

So, how do they achieve this impossible task of selecting members? They do that by giving  a set of tasks to the aspirants.  

And like every aspirant, I too looked forward to joining the club a month ago. However, when I saw the set of tasks that we were given, I thought that doing these tasks parallelly with doing assignments that I was given because of my course would have been next to impossible.

Having learnt basic C++ coding in my high school, I was afraid that I wouldn't be abe to do the tasks that used languages like rust, python and javascript. However, I didn't give up hope and started searching the all knowing google for some help. Google, as always didn't disappoint and sooner rather than later I had drawn up enough courage to start solving the tasks.

That was a month ago, and now I can only say that, indeed these tasks are really helpful for a person to  realise whether he is into coding or not.
