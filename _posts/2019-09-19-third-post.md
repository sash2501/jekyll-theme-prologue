The seniors of the amfoss club proved that, indeed, they are great mentors by giving us one more week's time to finish the tasks. A very common issue that all freshers were facing was lack of sufficient time to finish the task due to their hectic courses.

At the beginning of the week I had attempted all the tasks that I felt were a bit easier. However, tasks related to Javascript, GraphQL were left to be tried "some other time". Well, everyone knows that "some other time" never really comes.

However, sitting in the lab and trying the tasks there, felt more comfortable than doing it in my room where no one could guide me if I needed help. I was admitedly stuck at the task related to javascript for a very long time with no idea on how to proceed further. But this week I learnt many new things.

I had no clue what a js file meant, that java and javascript were actually two entirely different languages and I can actually make something using js files.

But, now that the week is over I have tried the two problems that were related to javascript and a bit more.

Below are the Tasks that I attempted this past week:)

<b>Task 5 : Get it using Javascript</b><br>
This is the task that I was stuck at for 4-5 days. That would be because I was initially trying to do this task using java. However it was only after my mentor told me that they are two entirely different languages that I realised that I was going in a very different direction. Had I been in my room, I would have realised that a bit later, and hence, would have lost more time. So i first learnt about what i graphQL , what are queries , mutations,etc. Then I search about queries that search for users. Having written that, I wrote the script.js file and then tried to link the html and js file. However, when I opened the wbpage it was showing errors. I tried removing them, rewote my code but in vain. Because of this, the task got dragged on for days. So, I started doing the next task related to javascript.

<b>Task 11: The Pong Game</b><br>
Prior to this task, I had no clue what a pong game really meant.However after trying task 5 for many days, I had understood how a javascript file really works. I learnt the uses of various javascript functions like addEventListener, requestAnimation frame, etc. I watched youtube videos of how the pong game works and referred it to try this task.
<b>Blockers : </b><br>
I first tried to move one player using keys, however, that didn't work out. So player one follows the mouse. Player two follows the ball. So, it is still a single player and offline game:(

<b>Task 13 : Project Euler</b><br>
I didn't try this task earlier thinking that it would some complecated maths problem. However, after trying it out, I realised that I was wrong. I have used c++ to solve these problems
